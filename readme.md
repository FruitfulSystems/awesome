This is a hard fork of sindresorhus/awesome and reorganized to suit my needs but hopefully it's useful to others. I love awesome lists and I have a bit of OCD with knowledge bases and ontologies. 

This repo is still a work in progress to get it up to snuff. Especially the table of contents and even the general organization.

I foresee this list to be a lot bigger than the original awesome list because I will be filling out the rest of the broader categories over time as the upstream repo is clearly and understandably IT based.
